========

Pointbot is an adaptation of [/u/Goldensights](reddit.com/user/goldensights)' [ReplyBot](https://github.com/voussoir/reddit/tree/master/ReplyBot). It is designed for use in [/r/theydidthemath](reddit.com/r/theydidthemath) and its Request Point system (similar to /r/changemyview's delta system.) It parses comments by posters in their own thread and will reply with a specific message if a string ("trigger") from one of multiple preset sets of strings is found. It will not issue a reply if an "antitrigger" from a preset set of strings is found.
